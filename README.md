# TavliScoreCounter
My second project for Google Challenge Scholarship: Android Basics Topics
In Greece "tavli" is a version of backgammon. Three games ("plakoto", "fevga" and "portes") are normally played consecutively, in three-, five- or seven-point matches. The first player who bears off all his fifteen checkers is the winner of the game. If the losing player has successfully borne off at least one checker, he loses only one point, otherwise two points are lost. Keeping the score is not that easy and so my second project is about that
